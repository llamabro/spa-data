# spa-data

### Temp repository for SPA-data site

Contains the files necessary for Jekyll site accessible at https://spa-data.github.io/spa-data/

Changes can be made in local repository and pushed to origin, or edited through web interface.

In either case, since the website is generated from files in 'gh-pages' branch, all changes must be made there.

(Or perhaps made in master branch and then merged with gh-pages branch...)
